## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

In Nigeria, there are some challenges that hinder crowdfunding, its growth and potential. Some of these challenges are:

- Regulatory issues: There is no comprehensive legal framework to regulate crowdfunding platforms and protect investors and entrepreneurs.

- Trust and transparency: There is a lack of trust and confidence among investors and entrepreneurs due to insufficient information disclosure and verification .

- Double taxation: There is a possibility of being taxed twice by both the government and the crowdfunding platform on the same income.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
